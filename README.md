HealthCare-Domain-ECG-Covid19 project:

## HealthCare-Domain-ECG-Covid19: Decoding Hearts in the Age of Corona 🫀🦠

### Project Overview 🚀

Ever wondered if an ECG could tell more than just your heart's rhythm? This project dives deep into the world of electrocardiograms (ECGs) to detect a range of heart conditions, including COVID-19-related abnormalities, past heart attacks, myocardial diseases, and irregular heartbeats, all alongside the rhythm of a healthy heart. It's where machine learning meets cardiology!

### What's Inside? 📦

*   **Dataset**:
    *   `Abnormal_Heart_Beat`: When hearts skip a beat (or add one).
    *   `Covid19_Patients`: ECGs from patients affected by COVID-19.
    *   `MI_History`: The echoes of heart attacks past.
    *   `Myocardial`: Decoding myocardial diseases.
    *   `Normal`: The steady rhythms of healthy hearts.
*   **Jupyter Notebook**:
    *   `HealthCare-Domain-ECG-Covid19.ipynb`: The heart of our analysis, containing all the code, visualizations, and machine learning models.

### Tech Stack 💻

*   `os`: Navigating the file system, one directory at a time.
*   `numpy`: Crunching numbers with precision.
*   `pandas`: Wrangling data into submission.
*   `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting the heart's story.
*   `seaborn`: Making our visualizations pop!
*   `warnings`: Silencing the unnecessary noise.

### Data at a Glance 📊

Here's a quick snapshot of our dataset:

*   Abnormal Heart Beat: 546
*   COVID-19 Patients: 250
*   MI History: 203
*   Myocardial: 74
*   Normal: 859

Total Beats: 1932

### Get Started 🏃‍♀️

1.  **Set Up Your Environment**: Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.  Run: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
2.  **Point to Your Data**: Adjust the `dataset_path_train` variable in the notebook to point to your local dataset directory.
3.  **Run the Show**: Open `HealthCare-Domain-ECG-Covid19-7th-April-2024.ipynb` in Jupyter and let the analysis begin!
